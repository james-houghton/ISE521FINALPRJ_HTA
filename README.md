[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/james-houghton/ISE521FINALPRJ_HTA/binder_version)

This repository and associated Binder{thingy) were prepared by G. Aiello, F. Gro√ü, and J. Houghton

NOTES:
I going to try to organize/structure everything for our final presentation and outline everything here. The binder_version branch of this repo will be used to continue implementing the Basic_example. This version will (eventually) outline each section and include placeholders with descriptions of the content that will eventually go there. Continue to use the binder_version branch and move content over incrementally once it is working/finished.

Let me know anything if there are any many changes that need to be made or if you have any questions, comments, concerns.
