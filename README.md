# NOTES: (this will be removed before final presentation)
I going to try to organize/structure everything for our final presentation and outline everything here (https://github.com/james-houghton/ISE521FINALPRJ_HTA/blob/master/README.md). The binder_version branch of this repo will be used to continue implementing the Basic_example. This version will (eventually) outline each section and include placeholders with descriptions of the content that will eventually go there. Continue to use the binder_version branch (for coding and link to lauch Binder) and I can move content over incrementally once it is working/finished.

I will also try to add note to the Basic_Example notebook so take a look and et me know anything if there are any major changes that need to be made or if you have any questions, comments, concerns.

This repository and associated Binder{thingy) were prepared by G. Aiello, F. Groß, and J. Houghton

#### Introduction:

#### Literature Review:


#### HTA Procedure:

1. Define Task Under Analysis
- To create a data visualization tool for voter density data of a state(s) (Rhode Island) to infer voter arrival trends  (Why used → make repeatable, sub-goals, organize tasks, challenges, relevance in that context → goal to understand what needs to be done)

2. Data Collection Process
- Automatic data collection is part of voting process, by digital check in process
- Some states do not use a digital voting system*

3. Determine overall Goal of the Task
- Visually represent arrival patterns given user specific defined variables by creating an interactive web application for the generation of maps

4. Sub Goal of the task
- Geo-data (adding data)
- Election data
- Form --Home screen--method --variable declaration (time, election data)
- Style characteristics
- Creation

5. Sub-Goal Decomposition


6. Plans Analysis
