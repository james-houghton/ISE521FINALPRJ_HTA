# NOTES: (this will be removed before final presentation)
I going to try to organize/structure everything for our final presentation and outline everything here (https://github.com/james-houghton/ISE521FINALPRJ_HTA/blob/master/README.md). The binder_version branch of this repo will be used to continue implementing the Basic_example. This version will (eventually) outline each section and include placeholders with descriptions of the content that will eventually go there. Continue to use the binder_version branch (for coding and link to lauch Binder) and I can move content over incrementally once it is working/finished.

I will also try to add note to the Basic_Example notebook so take a look and et me know anything if there are any major changes that need to be made or if you have any questions, comments, concerns.
